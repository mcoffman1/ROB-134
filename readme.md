# ROB-134 – Robotic Perception & Manipulation

> **Note:** This repository contains code and reference materials for students enrolled in the ROB-134 course: *Robotic Perception and Manipulation*. All files are custom made and intended as **learning resources**, not pre-built solutions.

## 📚 About This Repository

This repository is designed to help you explore key topics in robotic perception and manipulation, using tools like **OpenCV**, basic image processing, and computer vision techniques.

It includes:

- 🧪 Reference scripts for learning and experimentation
- 🧰 A work-in-progress **project folder** that students are welcome to explore and contribute to

---

## 🧠 How to Use This Repository

- Use the example scripts in the `ROB-134/` folder to learn about and experiment with core perception techniques.
- Feel free to modify, extend, or break the code as part of your learning.
- The `project/` folder is optional — it's an in-progress project that demonstrates how opencv can be used in ways similar to ROB-145. You’re welcome to:
  - Explore the code and ideas
  - Ask questions about how it works
  - Contribute improvements or ideas if you're interested
